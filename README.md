# IMDB-Database-Automatic-Movie-Picker
Graphical interface to find the perfect movie querying the IMDB database.


## Requirements

- Tkinter
- Pandas
- IMDBpy
- Numpy


## Description

A Tkinter-based GUI for the movie enthusiasts that hate spending hours looking for the perfect movie to see in a Saturday night. With some basic parameters, you can query the 23 MILLION movies that are in the IMDB database.
Every movie is sent as a request to the database so it takes A LOT of time getting the info, so, when you are ready to start the search, go and get a tea or make some popcorn meanwhile. All the GUI looks like a GUI made by an back-end developer, so..., yeah...

The results are shown in a scrolling window with the results formatted as plain text. THEN you can SORT them by box-office $$, alphabetical or by score; so you don't even have to spend time looking for that. Art should be accessible. As long as you have money to rent the movie on Amazon.

## Why does it take time?

The IMDB API supports certain queries and I had to +- adapt the code. So the search is inefficient. Sorry but I'm just a human.
